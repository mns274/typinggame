# typinggame

Created a typing game for class, which I took inspiration from Typing of the Dead on Dreamcast. 

Type the word you see on the screen to score a point, and do it before the ball on the right hits the 
bottom of the screen.

If you mess up typing, you can hit backspace/delete to reset your word and type again. 

Credits to the sound and music are in the code!
